# Comprehensive Study Guide for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## HTML: Structure and Semantics

### Basic Structure

- An HTML document starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, followed by the `<html>` element.
- The `<head>` element contains metadata, such as the `<title>` and links to stylesheets.
- The `<body>` element includes the content users interact with.

### Elements and Tags

- **Tags** define HTML elements, enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`), typically with an opening (`<p>`) and closing tag (`</p>`).
- **Block-level elements** (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`) start on a new line, while **inline elements** (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`) do not disrupt text flow.

### Attributes

- Attributes provide additional information about elements. Common attributes include `id`, `class`, `src`, and `href`.
  - Example: `<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>`

### Hyperlinks

- The `<a>` tag creates hyperlinks. The `href` attribute specifies the URL.
  - Example: `<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>`

### Forms and Inputs

- Forms (`<form>`) collect user input, containing various input types like text fields, checkboxes, and buttons.

### Media Elements

- Images: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`
- Audio/Video: Use `<audio>` and `<video>` tags with controls for playback.

## CSS: Styling and Layout

### Overview

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** styles HTML elements, controlling layout, colors, fonts, etc., allowing separation of content from design.

### Selectors

- Patterns used to select elements for styling.
  - Type selectors (`p`), class selectors (`.classname`), ID selectors (`#idname`).

### Box Model

- Describes element structure: content, padding, border, margin.
  - **Content Box**: Area where text/images appear.
  - **Padding Box**: Space between content and border.
  - **Border Box**: Surrounds padding with color/style.
  - **Margin Box**: Space outside the border.

### Flexbox and Grid Layouts

- **Flexbox**: One-dimensional layout for arranging items in rows/columns.
- **Grid Layout**: Two-dimensional system defining rows/columns.

### Responsive Design

- Ensures web applications work on all devices using media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images.

## JavaScript: Interactivity and Logic

### Overview

- JavaScript enables interactive web pages. It manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) and runs in browsers.

### Variables and Data Types

- Declared using `let`, `const`, or (deprecated) `var`. Types include strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects.

### Functions

- Blocks of code for specific tasks. Defined using traditional syntax or arrow functions (`=>`).

### DOM Manipulation

- Change HTML content using methods like `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, `innerHTML`.

### Events

- Respond to events (clicks/key presses) using event listeners (`addEventListener`).

## Advanced Topics

### Promises and Async/Await

- Promises handle asynchronous operations with states: pending, fulfilled, rejected.
- `async/await` simplifies promise handling by writing asynchronous code synchronously.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

- Lightweight data-interchange format easy for humans/machines to read/write. Used to transmit data between server/web application.
